# Machine Learning

A collection of Jupyter notebooks implementing core **machine** learning algorithms from scratch and with popular libraries. This repository is intended for learning, experimentation, and quick reference.

## Contents

- `KNN.ipynb` – k-Nearest Neighbors for classification and regression.  
- `Logistic Regression.ipynb` – Logistic regression for binary classification.  
- `Naive Bayes.ipynb` – Naive Bayes classifier for categorical and text data.  
- `Decision_Tree.ipynb` – Decision tree classifier and visualization.  
- `Ensemble.ipynb` – Ensemble methods such as bagging, random forest, or boosting.  
- `PCA.ipynb` – Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction.  
- `Neural Networks.ipynb` – Basic feedforward neural networks.  

_All notebooks are written in Jupyter Notebook (Python) and focus on clear, step-by-step implementations._

## Getting Started
